# Respiratory-Disease-Classification
Deep learning project that classifies respiratory disease from chest X-ray images.

## Project Overview
This project classifies different *respiratory diseases* using a trained machine learning model. The model can predict multiple types of respiratory illnesses, such as *COVID-19, pneumonia, and others. It includes a **simple and user-friendly GUI* where input data can be uploaded to get predictions.  

> Note: This project is for demonstration purposes only. No installation or execution is required.

## Features
- Predict multiple types of respiratory diseases from input data
- Simple GUI for uploading files
- Pre-trained model included for reference
- Command-line scripts available for demonstration

## File Structure
- data/ - Test datasets (test.csv, test_data_set.csv)
- models/ - Trained model file (Phenomenon_Classifier_Model.h5)
- src/ - Python scripts: main.py, gui.py, lung_disease_detection.py
- README.md - Project overview and details

## How it works (Overview)
- The trained model classifies multiple respiratory diseases.
- Users can see how the GUI or scripts would process input data to generate predictions.  
- This project is intended for educational or portfolio demonstration purposes.

## Libraries Used
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Tkinter
- NumPy
